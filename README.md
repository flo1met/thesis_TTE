# Improving Causal Inference from Observational Data: A Comparative Analysis of Confidence Interval Methods in Sequential Target Trial Emulation

This repository contains the code and data used in the master thesis: *"Improving Causal Inference from Observational Data: A Comparative Analysis of Confidence Interval Methods in Sequential Target Trial Emulation"* by Florian Metwaly, supervised by [Ois√≠n Ryan](https://ryanoisin.github.io/) and [Wouter van Amsterdam](https://wvanamsterdam.com/). In the thesis we investigate the performance of various confidence interval methods in the context of sequential Target Trial Emulation, using a simulation study. The final thesis can be found in `00_documents/Thesis_Metwaly.pdf`.
All data was simulated using the code in this repository. The simulation study was conducted using R and Julia, and the results were analyzed using R. The code is organized into different folders, each containing the code for a specific part of the thesis. For specifics on the code, please refer to the README files in each folder.
Ethical approval for the simulation study has been granted by the FETC at Utrecht University under case number 24-2059.
The repository is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/flo1met/thesis_TTE) and licenced under the GNU General Public License v3.0. See the `LICENSE.md` file for more details. This repository ensures that all code and data are publicly available indefinetly and can be used for future research.
