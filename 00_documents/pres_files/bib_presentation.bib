	abstract = {Target trial emulation has drastically improved the quality of observational studies investigating the effects of interventions. Its ability to prevent avoidable biases that have plagued many observational analyses has contributed to its recent popularity. This review explains what target trial emulation is, why it should be the standard approach for causal observational studies that investigate interventions, and how to do a target trial emulation analysis. We discuss the merits of target trial emulation compared with often used, but biased analyses, as well as potential caveats, and provide clinicians and researchers with the tools to better interpret results from observational studies investigating the effects of interventions.},

	abstract = {Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are regarded as the gold standard for estimating causal treatment effects on health outcomes. However, RCTs are not always feasible, because of time, budget or ethical constraints. Observational data such as those from electronic health records (EHRs) offer an alternative way to estimate the causal effects of treatments. Recently, the ‘target trial emulation’ framework was proposed by Hernán and Robins (2016) to provide a formal structure for estimating causal treatment effects from observational data. To promote more widespread implementation of target trial emulation in practice, we develop the R package TrialEmulation to emulate a sequence of target trials using observational time-to-event data, where individuals who start to receive treatment and those who have not been on the treatment at the baseline of the emulated trials are compared in terms of their risks of an outcome event. Specifically, TrialEmulation provides (1) data preparation for emulating a sequence of target trials, (2) calculation of the inverse probability of treatment and censoring weights to handle treatment switching and dependent censoring, (3) fitting of marginal structural models for the time-to-event outcome given baseline covariates, (4) estimation and inference of marginal intention to treat and per-protocol effects of the treatment in terms of marginal risk differences between treated and untreated for a user-specified target trial population. In particular, TrialEmulation can accommodate large data sets (e.g., from EHRs) within memory constraints of R by processing data in chunks and applying case-control sampling. We demonstrate the functionality of TrialEmulation using a simulated data set that mimics typical observational time-to-event data in practice.},

	abstract = {Propensity score methods are used to reduce the effects of observed confounding when using observational data to estimate the effects of treatments or exposures. A popular method of using the propensity score is inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). When using this method, a weight is calculated for each subject that is equal to the inverse of the probability of receiving the treatment that was actually received. These weights are then incorporated into the analyses to minimize the effects of observed confounding. Previous research has found that these methods result in unbiased estimation when estimating the effect of treatment on survival outcomes. However, conventional methods of variance estimation were shown to result in biased estimates of standard error. In this study, we conducted an extensive set of Monte Carlo simulations to examine different methods of variance estimation when using a weighted Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the effect of treatment. We considered three variance estimation methods: (i) a naïve model-based variance estimator; (ii) a robust sandwich-type variance estimator; and (iii) a bootstrap variance estimator. We considered estimation of both the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect in the treated. We found that the use of a bootstrap estimator resulted in approximately correct estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals with the correct coverage rates. The other estimators resulted in biased estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals with incorrect coverage rates. Our simulations were informed by a case study examining the effect of statin prescribing on mortality. © 2016 The Authors. Statistics in Medicine published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},
