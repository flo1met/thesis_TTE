## Causal Inference

-   **Randomized control trials** are the **gold standard** of causal inference
-   But, not always feasible
    -   Ethical limitations
    -   Practical limitations

→ More and more common to use **observational data**

- Observational prone to biases


::: notes
-   Lets first talk about the Gold Standard in Causal Inference, RCTs
-   example: smoking on lung cancer -\> unethical and would take decades
-   especially in health sciences, use of large scale observational data, like EHR

- Obs data has biases, or biases are easily introduced by design
→ Led to the development of the **sequential Target Trial Emulation** framework
:::


## Sequential Target Trial Emulation

- Copying of observations
-   **Confidence Intervals** can't be estimated directly
    -   One individual can be in multiple trials \
      → Violates independence assumption
- Literature recommends **non-parametric bootstrap**
- In practice: **sandwich-type estimators**

**How do non-parametric bootstrap confidence intervals compare to the sandwich-type confidence intervals?**



## Methods

- Simulation Study
  - Sandwich-type estimator
  - Non-parametric bootstrap
    - Empirical bootstrap
    - Percentile bootstrap
  - 81 scenarios

- Development of `TargetTrialEmulation.jl`
  - A Julia package for computational efficient estimation of bootstrap confidence intervals

::: notes
- in practice: sandwich estimators
- sandwich: analytic, but conservative
- TTE itself is already computationally expensive, therefore in statistical software the analytic sandwich estimators are implemented. Bootstrap adds another layer of computational complexity.
- 81 params over different sample sizes, outcome event rates, treatment prevalences
:::

## Results

- **Bootstrap CIs** are **narrower** in some cases in small and medium sample sizes
- Bootstrap **coverage** is **more often closest to 95%** 
- **Performance degrades** at high event rates or large sample sizes

| Method      | Closest to 95% |
|-------------|----------------|
| Sandwich    | 24.7%          |
| Empirical   | 36.3%          |
| Percentile  | 39.0%          |

## Results

- **Point estimates are biased**, especially with:
  - Small sample sizes
  - High outcome event rates
  - Later follow-up times

- **Bootstrap distributions are skewed**
  - Empirical bootstrap assumes symmetry
  - Percentile more robust to skew, but **sensitive to bias**

- **Undercoverage is mainly due to bias**

## Conclusion & Future Outlook

- Non-parametric bootstrap shows potential, but **more research** needed
- Alternative: **Bias-corrected accelerated bootstrap**

- Computational efficiency
  - **ABC** interval
